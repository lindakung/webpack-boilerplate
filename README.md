# webpack-boilerplate
Another bare bones boilerplate using Webpack. Almost all of it was inspired from Sean Larkin's Webpack 4 course on Frontend Masters.

## Setup

To use this boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

* Don't fork or clone this repo! Instead, create a new, empty directory on your machine and `git init` (or create an empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine)
* Run the following commands:

```
git remote add <remote name> https://github.com/lindakung/webpack-boilerplate.git
git fetch <remoate name>
git merge <remote name>/master
```
